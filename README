sgelib
======

An Ada frontend to Grid Engine

By Ansgar Esztermann <aeszter@mpibpc.mpg.de>

1. Goal
This library began its life as part of qview (by the same author).
When the Balancer was started, it soon became apparent that massive
amounts of code would need to be duplicated or reused.
Thus, the code that calls qstat, qhost etc and stores their output in
suitable data structures was extracted from qview, becoming 
sgelib 0.1.

2. Requirements
The following libraries are needed:

  * Florist (POSIX API)
  * ADAcgi
  * XMLAda

Of course, a working Grid Engine installation is also necessary.

3. Shortcomings/Bugs
For an up-to-date list of bugs, see the issue tracker on GitHub.
Here, let it just be noted that sgelib does not strive to provide a
consistent API, or full access to every bit of data output by qstat.
Instead, it evolves along with qview and the Balancer, serving as a
collection of common data and code. This has been hinted at by keeping
the major version at 0.
Moreover, ome values (e.g. available network types, CPU categories) are
hard-coded in the source. This means that all the advantages that
Ada enumeration types have over a dynamic array are available; but
users will have to edit the source code in order to adapt the program to
their environment.
Site-specifics have been marked with 
pragma Compile_time_Warning ("hardcoded config")
